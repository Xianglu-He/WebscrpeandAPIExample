Projects with Web Scraping and API 
This file contains the python code that I have been worked on for Web Scraping projects and API projects. 
Web Scrape Proj:
Example 1 --- It scrapes Ebay First 100 listed Ipad title information, condition type, listing price, and shipping type. It could also 
further identify sponsored items as well. This information are saved in pandas DataFrame and further transform and load it to local Mysql
to perform further analysis. 

Example 2 --- It scrapes us news website article information. It allows the user to scrape a specific article and tokenize 
the paragraph to find a specific sentence. 

Example 3 --- It scrapes a interactive chart at CAISO website. I used web driver to simulate a user behavior. I managed selenium package to
click and display the tool tip and save the data points into Pandas DataFrame. I further connected with my personl GCP Bigquery to store the
data I scraped.
